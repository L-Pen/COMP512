1. How do the number of players and the interval between moves impact the time until
a move is accepted and the rate at which moves are accepted (the number of moves
the system processes per time unit). - You will have to work by varying the number
of players and interval between moves to see how this pans out.

Number of Players, Average Acceptance Time (constant at 100ms and 50 moves)
2, 
3, 
4,
5, 
6, 
7,
8,
9,


Interval, Average Acceptance Time (constant at 3 players and 50 moves)
500, 
250, 
100, 
50, 
25, 
10, 
5, 
1, 


3. What is the maximum number of moves that your system can process per time unit
when the interval approaches 0? - does it even has to reach 0 before this rate flattens
out? Does this change as you increase the number of players?
